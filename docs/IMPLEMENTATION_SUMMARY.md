### 2. LangGraph Multi-Agent Workflow ✅
Implemented 4 specialized agent nodes:

**ClassifyNode**
- Department, team, and priority prediction using structured JSON output

## Known Limitations

### Current State (MVP)
1. **Local Development Focus**
   - In-memory queues (production requires Azure Service Bus migration)
   - No persistent decision log storage in dev (requires Cosmos DB setup)
   - Single-instance only (no horizontal scaling)

2. **Mock AI Components**
   - Azure AI Search index not populated (requires initial KB ingestion)
   - Confluence/SharePoint connectors not actively pulling data (manual setup required)
   - SLA prediction uses heuristics (not ML model yet)

3. **UI Incomplete**
   - Review workflow not fully implemented (view-only dashboard)
   - No approval/override actions
   - Static metrics (not live data from Cosmos DB)

4. **Authentication**
   - No Azure AD integration in UI (local dev only)
   - No webhook signature validation (documented for production)
   - No rate limiting or throttling

### Next Steps for Production (Phase 2)
1. **Migrate to Azure Services** (Week 1-2)
   - Deploy .NET apps to App Service
   - Deploy Python agent to Container Instances
   - Configure Azure Service Bus topics
   - Initialize Cosmos DB container
   - Populate Azure AI Search index with KB content

2. **Security Hardening** (Week 2-3)
   - Enable Azure AD authentication for UI
   - Implement webhook signature validation
   - Configure Managed Identity for all services
   - Set up RBAC policies
   - Enable HTTPS/TLS everywhere

3. **UI Completion** (Week 3-4)
   - Implement approval workflow (approve/reject/override)
   - Build ticket detail view with full decision provenance
   - Add live metrics dashboard (Cosmos DB queries)
   - User action audit logging

4. **Knowledge Base Ingestion** (Week 3-4)
   - Set up Confluence connector to sync spaces
   - Configure SharePoint connector for document libraries
   - Generate embeddings for all documents
   - Upload to Azure AI Search with metadata

5. **Testing & Validation** (Week 4)
   - End-to-end integration tests with Azure services
   - Load testing (1000 tickets/hour target)
   - Security penetration testing
   - Compliance audit (SOC 2, GDPR)

## Cost Optimization Recommendations

### Current Architecture (Standard Tier)
**Monthly Cost**: $780-$1,080

### Cost Reduction Strategies
1. **App Service**: Consider B1 tier ($55/month) instead of B2 for low traffic
2. **Azure AI Search**: Start with Basic tier ($75/month) instead of Standard ($250/month)
3. **Cosmos DB**: Use serverless billing model for variable workloads
4. **OpenAI**: Implement aggressive caching to reduce token usage by 40-60%
5. **Container Instances**: Use App Service for Containers instead for better pricing

**Optimized Monthly Cost**: $400-$600
