---

## Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive analysis of the JIRA Triage Agent Platform's current limitations and planned enhancements. While Phase 1 has delivered a production-ready system with Azure integration, AI-powered classification, and human-in-the-loop review, several areas require future development to achieve enterprise-scale maturity.

---

## 1. Current Limitations (Phase 1)

### 1.1 Functional Limitations

#### 1.1.1 Single Language Support
**Limitation:** English-only ticket classification

**Impact:**
- Cannot handle tickets in Spanish, French, German, etc.
- Global teams must submit tickets in English
- Reduces adoption in multi-national organizations

**Workaround:**
- Require English ticket submissions (policy enforcement)
- Use Google Translate API for basic translation (future Phase 2)

**Priority:** Medium  
**Estimated Effort:** 4 weeks (multi-language LLM prompts + language detection)

#### 1.1.2 No Auto-Resolution
**Limitation:** System cannot automatically close tickets

**Impact:**
- All tickets require human assignment (even simple ones)
- Missed opportunity for fully automated resolution of common issues
- Higher operational cost

**Workaround:**
- Manual closure by assigned team member
- Knowledge base articles guide users to self-service

**Priority:** High  
**Estimated Effort:** 6 weeks (workflow automation + confidence thresholds + testing)

#### 1.1.3 Limited Vertical Slices
**Limitation:** Only IT, HR, Finance, Legal verticals implemented

**Current Verticals:**
- IT Support (DBA, DevOps, Security, Networking)

- **R&D:** Research tools, lab access

**Impact:**
- Departments outside these verticals cannot use the system
- Requires custom configuration for each new department

**Priority:** Medium  
**Estimated Effort:** 2 weeks per new vertical (prompts + KB integration + testing)

#### 1.1.4 No Feedback Loop for Model Improvement
**Limitation:** Human overrides not used for model retraining

**Impact:**
- AI model doesn't learn from human corrections
- Classification accuracy doesn't improve over time
- Repeated errors on similar ticket types

**Current State:**

- No automated retraining pipeline

**Priority:** High  
**Estimated Effort:** 8 weeks (ML pipeline + data labeling + evaluation framework)

#### 1.1.5 No Conversational Interface
**Limitation:** No Slack/Teams bot for interactive triage

**Impact:**
- Users must go to JIRA to create tickets
- No conversational AI for ticket disambiguation
- Missed opportunity for guided ticket creation

**Priority:** Medium  
**Estimated Effort:** 6 weeks (Slack Bolt app + conversational prompts + state management)

---

### 1.2 Technical Limitations

#### 1.2.1 Synchronous Processing Only
**Limitation:** Worker processes tickets sequentially (one at a time per instance)

**Impact:**
- Maximum throughput: ~3600 tickets/hour (1 ticket/second × 1 instance)
- Cannot handle burst traffic (e.g., 500 tickets from mass email incident)
- Queue depth increases during high load

**Current Mitigation:**
- Horizontal scaling (deploy multiple worker instances)
- Service Bus queue buffers traffic spikes

**Priority:** High  
**Estimated Effort:** 3 weeks (parallel processing + thread safety + testing)

#### 1.2.2 No Priority Queue
**Limitation:** All tickets processed in FIFO order (first-in, first-out)

**Impact:**

- No differentiation by business impact

**Priority:** High  
**Estimated Effort:** 2 weeks (priority queue implementation + routing logic)

#### 1.2.3 Limited Error Recovery
**Limitation:** Manual intervention required for failed tickets (dead letter queue)

**Impact:**
- Dead-lettered tickets require manual reprocessing
- No automatic retry with exponential backoff for transient failures
