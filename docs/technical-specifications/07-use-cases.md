---

## 6. Anti-Patterns (When NOT to Use This Solution)

### 6.1 Low Ticket Volume
**Scenario:** Small business with 50 tickets/month  
**Why It Fails:** AI cost ($24K/year) exceeds manual triage cost ($5K/year)  
**Alternative:** Manual triage or basic JIRA automation rules

### 6.2 Highly Subjective Classifications
**Scenario:** Creative agency routing design requests (subjective aesthetic judgments)  
**Why It Fails:** LLMs struggle with subjective criteria (no ground truth)  
**Alternative:** Human-only triage with peer review

### 6.3 No Existing Knowledge Base
**Scenario:** Startup with no documented processes  
**Why It Fails:** RAG requires KB articles for citation-based justification  
**Alternative:** Build KB first (6-12 months), then deploy AI

### 6.4 Unstructured Ticket Data
**Scenario:** Tickets with only screenshots, no text descriptions  
**Why It Fails:** Current system requires text for classification (OCR future enhancement)  
**Alternative:** Require text descriptions, or wait for Phase 3 (image analysis)
