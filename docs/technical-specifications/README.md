## Current Implementation Status

### ‚úÖ Implemented (Phase 1 Complete)

**Control Plane (.NET 8):**
- ‚úÖ JiraTriage.Webhook: HTTP endpoint for JIRA webhooks with DLP redaction
- ‚úÖ JiraTriage.Worker: Background service processing enriched tickets
- ‚úÖ JiraTriage.UI: Razor Pages dashboard for human review
- ‚úÖ JiraTriage.Core: Shared models and services (DlpRedactor, PolicyChecker)

**Reasoning Plane (Python 3.11):**
- ‚úÖ FastAPI service with `/process_ticket` endpoint
- ‚úÖ LangGraph multi-agent workflow (ClassifyNode, RetrieveNode, GenerateNode, PolicyNode)
- ‚úÖ Azure OpenAI integration (GPT-4/GPT-5, text-embedding-3-small)
- ‚úÖ Azure AI Search for hybrid vector+keyword search (RAG)
- ‚úÖ Azure Cosmos DB for immutable decision logging
- ‚úÖ Confluence & SharePoint connectors for knowledge retrieval
- ‚úÖ Enhanced policy engine with vertical slicing (IT, HR, Finance, Legal)
- ‚úÖ Application Insights observability

**Data Governance:**
- ‚úÖ PII redaction (emails, phones, SSNs, credit cards)
- ‚úÖ External email detection
- ‚úÖ Zero-trust architecture (raw data never sent to Python/LLM)

**Deployment:**
- ‚úÖ Development environment (Replit NixOS, in-memory queues)
- ‚úÖ Azure integration ready (Service Bus, Cosmos DB, AI Search, Key Vault)

### ‚è≥ Future Enhancements (Phases 2-4)

See [06-future-enhancements-and-limitations.md](06-future-enhancements-and-limitations.md) for complete roadmap:
- Phase 2 (Q1-Q2 2026): Active learning, multi-language support, auto-resolution
- Phase 3 (Q3-Q4 2026): Slack/Teams integration, attachment processing (OCR)
- Phase 4 (2027): Multi-tenant support, custom workflow engine, edge deployment

## Important Notes

### Current vs. Future State

**All documents clearly distinguish:**
- ‚úÖ **Implemented:** Features available in current codebase
- ‚è≥ **Planned:** Features in future phases (marked with phase numbers)
- ‚ùå **Out-of-Scope:** Explicitly excluded capabilities

**Example:**
- ‚úÖ LangGraph multi-agent classification: **Implemented**
- ‚è≥ Multi-language support (Spanish, French, etc.): **Phase 2 (Q1 2026)**
- ‚ùå Auto-ticket closure: **Out of Phase 1 scope**

### Development vs. Production

**Development Environment (Current):**
- In-memory queues (data lost on restart)
- Single instance deployment
- Environment variables for configuration

**Production Environment (Azure-Ready):**
- Azure Service Bus for durable messaging
- Azure Cosmos DB for persistent decision logs
- Multi-instance deployment with autoscaling
- Azure Key Vault for secret management

**Deployment Path:** Code is Azure-ready; transition requires configuration only (no code changes).
